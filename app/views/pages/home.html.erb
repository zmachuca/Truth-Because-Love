					<p>We all have that friend or family member that chews too loud, or smokes too much, or dare I say it, uses too much toilet paper. That kind behavior is unacceptable and can affect the lives of those around them. You have told them before, but they just won't listen.</p>
					<p>What is our solution you ask? Send them an <u>anonymous</u> intervention/cease and desist letter that is <strong>FILLED</strong> with love for minimal butt-hurt.</p>
					<p>For only $9.99 and an address anywhere in the world, we will send that "someone" in your life an anonymous letter that opens their eyes to a major issue. Know someone that says the word "like" too much? Not anymore. Know someone who leaves hair in the sink? Say "Hasta la vista, baby."

					<p>Fill out the form and press the "Buy Now" button via Stripe.</p>

					<p>That's right, we use Stripe, not only because we wanted to learn how to but because we're hip and edgy. Why else did we build this website with Rails? If we didn't care we would have obviously just built this with Node.js, the only real dev language.</p>
					<p>We will unecessarily accept even more methods of payment when we scale, which shouldn't be long at all.</p>
